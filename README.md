## 📌 Introduction

Principal Network Access Layer protocols, covering error detection methods & Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols like ALOHA and CSMA/CD, are implemented in Python in this repository.

## 📝 Exercises Overview
- Parity Bit for Error Detection: Implements generated error injection to demonstrate even parity verification. 
- Given a data matrix, a two-dimensional parity maximises the recognition of errors across rows and columns. 
- Such MAC protocols—CSMA/CD, Slotted ALOHA, and Pure ALOHA—are simulated with the objective to assess how efficient they are under the influence of varying transmission probabilities. 
- Plotting the performance of Pure ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, and CSMA/CD will enable throughput analysis when evaluating how effectively they operate.

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

- Required Python libraries:

```pip install matplotlib numpy```

- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm) or terminal.
